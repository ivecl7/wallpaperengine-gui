# WallpaperEngine GUI

GUI for the [Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine).
Now has a pluggable addon [wallpaper_not-engine_linux](https://github.com/MikiDevLog/wallpaper_not-engine_linux).
In short - will allow to run regular media files in full compatibility with regular wallpapers on x11 and Wayland too, just like in Wallpaper Engine (this feature is experemental due to lack of testing in different contitions, you can help with this, when you find any issue related to this addon, just submit it to [issues](https://github.com/MikiDevLog/wallpaper_not-engine_linux/issues))
- No need to transfer your pictures or videos to a separate folder, binding occurs via symlinks.
- The interface does not change much, allowing to use both types of wallpapers.

# Features

- Mostly automated first setup.
- Can get information about wallpaper based on workshop id using Steam API and store it. [You need to get API key for that](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) any domain name will do.
- Support QT Themes for KDE users.
- Somewhat usable in terms of design (but now even better).
- Restore previous state on restart.
- Has playlist support
- Has support for changing wallpaper properties that are specified in project.json with the ability to save them between launches and roll back to the default state
- Has support for individual settings (settings specific to linux-wallpaperengine) for running wallpapers
- Has support for working in the system tray
